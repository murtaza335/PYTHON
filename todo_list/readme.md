### Overview
The code is a simple command-line task management application. It allows users to add, delete, edit, and display tasks. The tasks are stored in a Python list imported from a file named `data.py`.

### Code Description

#### 1. Importing Tasks
```python
from data import tasks
```
This line imports a list named `tasks` from a module named `data`.

#### 2. Function: `update_file`
```python
def update_file():
    file = open("todo_list/data.py", "w")
    file.write(f"tasks = {tasks}")
    file.close()
```
This function updates the `data.py` file with the current list of tasks. It opens the file in write mode, writes the `tasks` list to the file, and then closes the file.

#### 3. Function: `add`
```python
def add():
    new_task = input("Add new task: ")
    tasks.append(new_task)
    update_file()
    print(f'Task: "{new_task}" has been added successfully.')
```
This function adds a new task to the `tasks` list. It prompts the user to input a new task, appends it to the list, updates the file, and prints a confirmation message.

#### 4. Function: `delete`
```python
def delete():
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
        print(i+1,".",tasks[i])
    inp = int(input("Which task do you want to delete? "))
    if inp-1 <= len(tasks) and inp-1 >= 0:
        del tasks[inp-1]
        update_file()
        print("Task successfully deleted ")
```
This function deletes a task from the `tasks` list. It displays all tasks with their indices, prompts the user to select a task to delete, removes the selected task from the list, updates the file, and prints a confirmation message.

#### 5. Function: `edit`
```python
def edit():
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
        print(i+1,".",tasks[i])
    inp = int(input("Which task do you want to edit? "))
    if inp-1 <= len(tasks) and inp-1 >= 0:
        tasks[inp-1] = input("Enter new task: ")
        update_file()
        print(f'Task: "{tasks[inp-1]}" has been successfully edited.')
```
This function edits an existing task in the `tasks` list. It displays all tasks with their indices, prompts the user to select a task to edit, updates the task with new input, updates the file, and prints a confirmation message.

#### 6. Function: `show`
```python
def show():
    print("All tasks: ")
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
        print(i+1,".",tasks[i])
```
This function displays all the tasks in the `tasks` list. It prints each task with its index.

#### 7. Main Loop
```python
while True:
    choice = int(input("(1) Add task\n(2) Delete task\n(3) Edit task\n(4) Show tasks\n(5) Exit\n"))
    if choice == 1:
        add()
    elif choice == 2:
        delete()
    elif choice == 3:
        edit()
    elif choice == 4:
        show()
    elif choice == 5:
        exit()
    else:
        print("Invalid Input")
```
This is the main loop that continuously runs the program until the user chooses to exit. It presents a menu to the user with options to add, delete, edit, show tasks, or exit the program. Based on the user's input, it calls the corresponding function. If the user inputs an invalid option, it prints an error message.

### Summary
This task management application allows users to perform basic operations on a list of tasks and persists changes to a file. It uses simple input/output operations to interact with the user and functions to manage the tasks and update the file.
