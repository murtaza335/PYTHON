### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. Importing Libraries and Initializing Data Structures:
```python
import random
```
- **random**: This is a standard Python library that provides functions for generating random numbers, which we'll use to create the password.

```python
alphabets = ('a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z')
numbers = (0, 1, 2, ..., 9)
special_characters = ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')', '-', '_', '=', '+', '[', ']', '{', '}', ';', ':', ',', '.', '<', '>', '/', '?', '|', '~')
```
- **alphabets**: A tuple containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z').
- **numbers**: A tuple containing digits ('0' to '9').
- **special_characters**: A tuple containing various special characters commonly used in passwords.

#### 2. Generating the Password:
```python
password = []
```
- **password**: An empty list where characters of the password will be stored.

#### 3. Adding Characters to the Password:

##### Lowercase Alphabets:
```python
for i in range(3):
    password.append(random.choice(alphabets))
```
- This loop appends three random lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) to the `password` list.

##### Numbers:
```python
for i in range(3, 6):
    password.append(random.choice(numbers))
```
- This loop appends three random digits (`0` to `9`) to the `password` list.

##### Special Characters:
```python
for i in range(6, 9):
    password.append(random.choice(special_characters))
```
- This loop appends three random special characters (from the `special_characters` tuple) to the `password` list.

##### Uppercase Alphabets:
```python
for i in range(9, 12):
    rand = random.choice(alphabets)
    password.append(rand.upper())
```
- This loop chooses a random lowercase letter (`'a'` to `'z'`), converts it to uppercase (`'A'` to `'Z'`), and appends it to the `password` list. This ensures that there are three uppercase letters in the password.

##### Additional Numbers:
```python
for i in range(12, 15):
    password.append(random.choice(numbers))
```
- This loop adds three more random digits (`0` to `9`) to complete the password length to 15 characters.

#### 4. Shuffling the Password:
```python
random.shuffle(password)
```
- This function shuffles the characters in the `password` list to randomize their order.

#### 5. Printing the Password:
```python
for i in password:
    print(i, end="")
```
- Finally, each character in the shuffled `password` list is printed on the same line without spaces (`end=""` ensures that `print()` doesn't add a newline after each character), resulting in the complete random password.

### Summary:
This code snippet effectively generates a random password of length 15 characters (due to the additional numbers added at the end), ensuring it includes a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The use of random selection and shuffling guarantees the password's security and unpredictability, making it suitable for secure applications where strong passwords are required.
