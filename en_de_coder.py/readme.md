### Overview
The code implements a simple text encoder and decoder. The encoding process involves reversing the input string, shifting each character by three positions in the ASCII table, and surrounding each character with random letters. The decoding process reverses these steps to retrieve the original text.

### Code Description

#### 1. Importing the `random` Library
```python
import random
```
This line imports the `random` library, which is used to generate random characters for the encoding process.

#### 2. Initializing Variables
```python
char_start_end = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
encode1_txt = []
```
- `char_start_end`: A list of lowercase alphabetic characters used to surround each encoded character.
- `encode1_txt`: An empty list that appears to be unused in the provided code.

#### 3. Function: `encode1`
```python
def encode1():
    user_text = input("Enter text to encode: ")
    user_text_reverse = ""
    # This loop reverses the input string
    for i in range(len(user_text)):
        single = user_text[-i-1]
        user_text_reverse += single
    words = user_text_reverse.split(" ")  # Divides the sentence into a list of words on each space
    print("encode string: ")
    for i in range(len(words)):
        x = words[i]
        for j in range(len(x)):
            new = ord(x[j])
            new += 3
            char = chr(new)
            final = random.choice(char_start_end) + char + random.choice(char_start_end)
            print(final, end="")
        print("#", end="")
```
This function encodes the input text as follows:
1. Reverses the input string.
2. Splits the reversed string into words.
3. Shifts each character in the word by three positions in the ASCII table.
4. Surrounds each shifted character with random letters from `char_start_end`.
5. Prints the encoded text, with `#` separating the encoded words.

#### 4. Function: `decode1`
```python
def decode1():
    user_text = input("Enter text to decode: ")
    list_en_letters_unfiltered = []
    final_list_reversed = []
    # Splitting the list on # symbol
    list_encrypted_words = user_text.split("#")
    # Looping through the list of encrypted words
    for i in range(len(list_encrypted_words)):
        single_encrypted_word = list_encrypted_words[i]
        # Looping through the single encrypted word
        for i in range(0, len(single_encrypted_word), 3):
            # Saving each encrypted letter surrounded by special characters in list of encrypted letters
            list_en_letters_unfiltered.append(single_encrypted_word[i:i+3])
    # Now loop through the list of encrypted letters and remove unwanted special characters from it.
    for i in range(len(list_en_letters_unfiltered)):
        # Saving each encrypted unfiltered (surrounded by special characters) letter in en_letter_unfiltered variable.
        en_letter_unfiltered = list_en_letters_unfiltered[i]
        # Removing first and last unwanted special character from en_letter_unfiltered and saving it in the variable en_letter_filtered
        en_letter_filtered = en_letter_unfiltered[1:-1]
        # Now we are left with only one character in the variable en_letter_filtered
        # So we take it back three steps as in encode()
        # Changing it to decimal code and then changing back to original one
        temp = ord(en_letter_filtered)
        temp -= 3
        de_char = chr(temp)
        final_list_reversed.append(de_char)
    # Printing the list in reverse order
    for i in range(len(final_list_reversed)):
        print(final_list_reversed[-i-1], end=" ")
```
This function decodes the input text as follows:
1. Splits the encoded text on `#` to separate words.
2. Extracts the actual characters by removing the surrounding random letters.
3. Shifts each character back by three positions in the ASCII table.
4. Reverses the order of characters to get the original text and prints it.

#### 5. Main Logic
```python
print("1. Encoding\n2. Decoding")
choice = int(input("Select operation: "))
if choice == 1:
    encode1()
elif choice == 2:
    decode1()
else:
    print("Invalid choice")
```
- The program prompts the user to choose between encoding and decoding.
- Based on the user's choice, it calls either the `encode1` or `decode1` function.
- If the user inputs an invalid choice, it prints an error message.

### Summary
This script provides a simple way to encode and decode text. The encoding process involves reversing the text, shifting characters, and surrounding them with random letters. The decoding process reverses these steps to retrieve the original text. The program includes a main menu that allows the user to choose between encoding and decoding operations.
